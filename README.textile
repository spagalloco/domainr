h1. domainr

Ruby wrapper for the "Domainr API":https://domainr.com/api.

h2. Installation

<pre><code>gem install domainr</code></pre>

h2. Usage

You can use Domainr to retrieve information about a domain:

<pre><code>Domainr.info('google.com')</code></pre>

You can also search Domainr based on a search term:

<pre><code>Domainr.search('twitter')</code></pre>

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
